flashrom (0.9.2+r1141-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Drop alpha and netbsd-alpha from the arch list for now (builds fail).
    + Keeping "urgency=high" due to high-priority fixes in the last upload,
      in order to allow those fixes to migrate to testing.
    + It's unclear how well alpha (if at all) is supported upstream at this
      point. There's a compile-time #error in the upstream code breaking
      the build intentionally on alpha right now.
      Alpha support will be re-enabled as soon as this has been sorted out
      upstream, but it may take quite a while.

flashrom (0.9.2+r1141-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. Urgency high due to multiple critical bugfixes that
    could potentially brick the PC (or worse: laptop) of users.
    Other important fixes include:
    + Properly writing Atmel AT25 chips would fail on some SPI controllers.
    + Fix breakage with brick-potential on various non-x86 architectures.
    + Fix broken reads on Winbond W25x16, especially on some ICH SPI chipsets.
    + Fix write failure on 3COM NICs with parallel flash.
    + Fix "byte merge" related corruption on some VIA chipsets.
    + Fix some format string bugs.
    + Fix hard hang on some recent (e.g. QM57) Intel chipsets.
  * Install new upstream udev rules file to allow users to use flashrom
    without root permissions on some (USB-based) programmers.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.1 (no changes required).
  * debian/copyright: Updates.

flashrom (0.9.1+r946-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
     + Urgency high, as it fixes multiple important bugs, including such bugs
       which can potentially "brick" a user's mainboard. Details at
       http://www.flashrom.org/pipermail/flashrom/2010-March/002507.html.
     + This build should have a non-truncated manpage (Closes: #566217).
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.4 (no changes required).

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Mar 2010 09:50:05 +0100

flashrom (0.9+r631-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
     + The command line usage has changed a bit in this release:
        + Combined operations like -wv or -Ewv are no longer allowed.
        + The -w option automatically does an auto-verify after writing
          (but you can also explicitly do it via 'flashrom -v file').
        + The -E option is also automatically verified per default.
     + Support for external programmers was added (-p), see manpage.
     + Acer Aspire One is now marked unsupported upstream (Closes: #528308).
  * Add build-dependency on libftdi-dev, flashrom now supports an
    external libftdi-based programmer (ft2232spi).
  * debian/patches/20_drop_svndef.patch: Drop, we use 'make tarball' now,
    which properly handles svn version printing in flashrom.
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.2 (no changes required).
  * debian/copyright: Update.

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Jun 2009 14:18:53 +0200

flashrom (0.0+r3274-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    + pciutils-dev was renamed to libpci-dev (Closes: #478379).
    + Drop ia64 from architectures list for now, unlikely to work.
    + Don't link with -lz anymore, don't build-depend on zlib1g-dev.
      We don't explicitly need zlib, libpci-dev now properly depends on it.
  * Add upstream changelog ('svn log' output) to the package (Closes: #467398).

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Sun, 04 May 2008 00:34:44 +0200

flashrom (0.0+r3073-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #462248).
    + Flashrom is now installed in /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin.
    + The manpage is now in section 8 (not 1).
    + Fix broken references to old bug tracker URL (Closes: #460554).
  * Restrict list of architectures to the known-working ones for now.
    More architectures will gradually be re-added if we're sure they work.
    + These are known to work: amd64, i386, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386
    + These should work (untested, though): alpha, hurd-i386, ia64,
      netbsd-alpha, netbsd-i386
    + These are disabled for now, as flashrom will very likely not work: arm,
      armel, armeb, hppa, m32r, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sh, sparc, s390
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/control:
     + Add Homepage field.
     + Update package description.
  * debian/copyright: Update URLs and list of authors.
  * Simplified packaging a bit.

flashrom (0.0+r2769-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not attempt to build flashrom on S/390, as it doesn't build
    and is not useful there anyway (Closes: #404342, #418712).
    It is yet to be determined on which other architectures flashrom can
    work and on which not.
  * Honour DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip variable by removing hardcoded 'strip'
    invocation in the Makefile and letting cdbs handle it (Closes: #436850).

    Alex de Oliveira Silva <enerv@host.sk>.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2.2 (no changes required).

flashrom (0.0+r2526-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not compile in DoC support (it's considered unsupported upstream).
